Model history:

 1. MiceaKitsune, original model, licensed under WTFPL.
 2. stu, addition of elbows and knees, licensed under WTFPL.
 3. Robert Zenz, several fixes and changes, re-licensed under CC-BY 4.0.

The set of changes include redone skinning, removal of duplicate surfaces and
changes to the animations (mostly easing).


Configuration
=============

The system can be configured by adding settings to the `minetest.conf`:

    # If the system should be activated, defaults to true.
    playermodel_activate = true
    
    # The name of the model to use, defaults to "character.x".
    playermodel_model_model = character.x
    
    # The name of the texture to use.
    playermodel_model_texture = character.png
    
    # The size of the model in two values, x and y, defaults to "1, 1".
    playermodel_model_size = 1, 1
    
    # The base speed of the animations, defaults to 30. Will be halved
    # for sneaking.
    playermodel_frame_speed = 30
    
    # The parameters that follow are the start and end frame (both inclusive)
    # of the animations.
    
    playermodel_animation_digging = 189, 199
    playermodel_animation_laying = 162, 167
    playermodel_animation_sitting = 81, 161
    playermodel_animation_standing = 0, 80
    playermodel_animation_walking = 168, 188
    playermodel_animation_walking_digging = 200, 220


Notes for changing the model
============================

If you want to export a x (DirectX) file from Blender, you'll need to set
the following options in the lower left panel:

 * [ ] Export Selected Objects Only
 * [X] Export Meshes
 * [X] Export Normals
 * [ ] Flip Normals
 * [X] Export UV Coordinates
 * [X] Export Materials
 * [X] Export Vertex Colors
 * [X] Export Skin Weights
 * [X] Apply Modifiers
 * [X] Export Amature Bones
 * [X] Export Rest Position
 * [X] Export Animations
 * [ ] Include Frame Rate
 * [ ] Export Actions as AnimationSets
 * [ ] Attach Unused Actions to First Amature
 * [ ] Verbose

There is a Solidify modifier set on the head, this is needed so that the hair
or hat or cap is also visible from "the inside".
